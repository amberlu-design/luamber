					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p> Being the Instagram lover that I am, I spend a lot of time on the app. While trying to implement effects to my stories, I realized some areas of UX that could be improved to enhance the user experience so decided to dive in and improve its functionality and intuitiveness.</p>

			<h3>What is Instagram Effects?</h3>
			<p>One of the most exciting features that were released on the platform was the effects and effect gallery. A quick disclaimer, effects are not the same as filters. Effects are implemented before a story was taken. One of the most popular effects is the "What Disney Character Are You?" random generator. Filters are applied after a story was taken. For example, different color filters like "Melbourne" and "Tokyo". Stories posted with effects are different from everyone elses, they add character and uniqueness and really shows off the users' personalities. Effects are mostly created by other users with a software, the rest are created by Instagram itself.</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p> Here is what the current story page looks like. (The position of "Normal", "Create", "Boomerang" varies by versions) The effect gallery is positioned on the rightmost side. Users have to scroll through around 15 trending effects suggested by Instagram itself to eventually get to the gallery.</p>

			<h3>User Research + Key Findings</h3>
			<p>After receiving responses from my survey and conducting in-person observations on 10 participants for my user research, I organized the data and concluded some key findings and pain points.</p>
			<br>
			<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
				<li>4/10 participants don’t know where the gallery is located.</li>
				<li>Participants who know where the gallery is therefore don’t browse it because it’s time consuming and hard to navigate.</li>
				<li>Many participants don’t understand what the different categories mean.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>The reason that Instagram chose to locate where the gallery is located is because they want the primary way of users discovering effects to be from their <span style="background-color:yellow">friends and followings</span>. This actually contradicts with what the user actually wants. From my research I deduced that even though users do find effects from their friends' stories, they actually want to <span style="background-color:yellow">find effects from the gallery on their own</span>.</p>
