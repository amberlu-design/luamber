				<h3 style="color:#DE630A">Starting Off</h3>
				<br>
				<p>I started going to boxing cardio studio with my friends. The classes and facilities are great, but I noticed a bottleneck in it's user journey. When checking in for the class, customers are looking for the <span style="color:; font-weight: bold">class reservation confirmation email that is in the midst of the countless emails received each day</span>. I decided to look into its service process, information flow and here I am designing an app that not only solves the problem but also streamlines the whole process!</p>

				<h3 style="color:#DE630A">Understanding the Problems</h3>
				<br>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">1. FINDING THE CONFIRMATION EMAIL WITH THE QR CODE USED FOR CHECKING IN</p>
				<p>Users receive a confirmation email after they have successfully reserved a class. The email contains the class details and a QR code for checking in at the front desk. We receive multiple dozens of emails a day so it's stressful and inconvenient for the users to have to find a confirmation email that was  sent 2 or 3 days ago or even longer.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
						<img src="img/work/bm/bm_emaileg.jpg" class="img-center" style="width:80%">
						<p id="img_cap">Screenshot of my inbox.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>Most of my emails are in English instead of Chinese and I don't get a lot of emails a day compared to most of my friends so the confirmation email is a bit easier to spot. Imagine needing to find this email in a midst of emails all in Chinese. Of course people would be stressed!</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>Why do users get stressed out by this? It's just like the slight stress you get when you're getting your credit card to pay for something but it's stuck in your wallet and everyone is waiting. It's a common thing people feel - <b>being unprepared or not ready when it's your turn.</b> Solving this problem would enhance the user experience.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">2. WEBSITE VS APP</p>
				<p>B Monster has a website that every user has to access in order to reserve classes and perform other membership realted issues. They also have a mobile application but the main feature for that is to connect to the heart rate monitor which they offer to track heart rate and calories burned.</p>
				<br>
				<img src="img/work/bm/BM_appvsweb.png" class="img-center" style="width:80%">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>I found that they have completely different features available. The lack of connection between the 2 platforms affects the user experience and how connected users feel to the whole brand. Also, their website isn't very user-centric but users have to frequently visit the website to perform a lot of tasks such as purchase pass, reserve class, enroll in waitlists, etc.</p>

				<h3 style="color:#DE630A">User Research + Pain Points</h3>
				<br>
				<p>I collected data through in-person interviews with B-Monster customers including my friends and people I met through classes. Here are the results:</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>"Forgetfullness"</b> due to the website's information structure and features being all over the place. There should be a place for current members to <b>accomplish all of their goals</b>.</li>
					<br>
					<p style="text-indent: 6%; color:grey;" >5/5 users often forget how many classes are left on their pass.</p>
					<p style="text-indent: 6%; color:grey;">3/5 users Often forget where and how to reserve classes.</p>
					<li>Many users try to reserve for the next class right after their current one is over which usually happens right after they leave the studio when they don't have access to their laptop. Going on to their website through their phones is very <b>inconvenient</b>.</li>
					<br>
					<p style="text-indent: 6%; color:grey;">2/5 users Wish there was an app to complete all necessary tasks.</p>
					<li>Some users would like to take their <b>favorite instructors</b> classes but it's not easy to try and remember their names so users have a hard time trying to reserve classes taught by their favorite instructors.</li>
					<br>
					<p style="text-indent: 6%; color:grey;">5/5 users Have favorite instructors but often forget their names.</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3 style="color:#DE630A">Takeaways</h3>
				<br>
				<p><b>1. Don't forget that the interface exists outside the screen boundaires</b></p>
				<p>When I was designing, I constantly find myself trying to fit everything in the screen boundaries which creates clutterd and chaotic designs. For me, it's important to keep in mind that users are scrolling around the app, they expect to find overflowing content outside of the screen boundaries. This creates opportunities for me to design micro interactions that brings users more joy.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>2. Recognize that a design is never finished</b></p>
				<p>More than often, I fixate on finding multiple solutions to a problem and trying to decide on which one is best. When I finally decide on one, the next day, I change my mind again. Because of this constant change, I find that I spend a lot of time on one small problem and not confident about my decisions. I think it's important to recognize that a design is never finished, there's always multiple solutions to a problem and more problems to be solved. That's why iterations and updates are important!</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3 style="color:#DE630A">Next Steps</h3>
				<br>
				<p>1. Since this app is designed for a business that actually exists, I would love to get in touch with the business and discuss how my research and design could help them solve their business problems.</p>
				<p>2. I would also love to explore the idea of a widget. Having a widget that contains the QR code could further improve the user experience. But, more research is needed.</p>
				<p>3. As mentioned previously, the website has very unorganized information. I could also expand this case study and redesign its website as well.</p>
