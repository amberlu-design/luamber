			<h2>Instagram Effect Gallery Redesign</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Being the Instagram lover that I am, I spend a lot of time on the app. While trying to implement effects to my stories, I realized some areas of UX that could be improved to enhance the user experience so I decided to dive in and improve its functionality and intuitiveness.</p>

			<h4>Instagram Effects?</h4>
			<br>
			<p>People often confuse effects with filters. Effects are implemented before a story was taken. It includes almost everything you can think of. Grainy, disposable camera, AR objects, games, etc. Filters are applied after a story was taken. They're all created by Instagram itself. Effects are mostly created by other users with a software, the rest are created by Instagram itself.</p>

				<h4>Problems</h4>
				<br>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; color:#1C01C7">1.Where is the effect library?</p>
				<img src="img/work/igredesign/story_current_browse.png" class="img-center" style="width:100%">
				<br>
				<p>The effect gallery is positioned on the rightmost side. Users have to scroll through around 15 trending effects suggested by Instagram itself to eventually get to the gallery.</p>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; color:#1C01C7">2. Unintuitive Navigation</p>

				<h4>User Research + Findings</h4>
				<br>
				<p>After receiving responses from my survey and conducting in-person observations on 10 participants for my user research, I organized the data and concluded some key findings and pain points.</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>4/10 participants donâ€™t know where the gallery is located.</li>
					<li>Participants who know where the gallery is donâ€™t browse it because itâ€™s time consuming and hard to navigate.</li>
					<li>Many participants donâ€™t understand what the different categories mean.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Project Objectives</h4>
				<br>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; color:#1C01C7">How might we improve the effect gallery's function and process?</p>
				<p>This includes reducing the effort needed from users to access the gallery and make the browsing of effects more user-friendly.</p>
				<br>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; color:#1C01C7">Business Goals vs User Goals</p>
				<p>The reason that Instagram chose to locate where the gallery is located is because they want the primary way of users discovering effects to be from their friends and followings. This actually contradicts with what the user actually wants. From my research I deduced that even though users do find effects from their friends' stories, they actually want to find effects from the gallery on their own.</p>

				<h4>Redesign</h4>
				<br>
				<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; color:#1C01C7">Solution for: low discoverability of effects gallery</p>
				<p>Where the effect gallery is currently located has low discoverability. It's hard to get to and some users don't even know a library exists.</p>
				<br>
				<img class="img-center" src="img/work/igredesign/ig_locationredesignideas.png" style="width:100%">
				<br>
				<p>Design A only displays 4 buttons and "looks like" it takes up more screen space.Design B wouldn't work because it clashes with the "cross" that comes up when users are scrolling through different effects. Also, when an effect has multiple versions, they come up there.</p>
				<p>I decided to go with Design C. It relocates the effect gallery next to home and it doesn't make unnecessary changes, so the users won't be confused and solves the problem of easy access and higher discoverability.</p>
				<br><br><br>	
				<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; color:#1C01C7">Solution for: Poor usability & intuitiveness for browsing effects</p>
				<br>
				<h5>ðŸ“¸ Viewing</h5>
				<br>
				<p>I went for design B because it displays the thumbnails with a shorter height but still enough for the users to view each effects properly.</p>
				<img class="img-center" src="img/work/igredesign/ig_libraryredesignideas.png" style="width:100%">
				<br><br>
				<h5>ðŸ“¸ Quick Save</h5>
				<br>
				<p>To help users navigate through the gallery more efficiently, I added a save button to the bottom right on each thumbnail. Many users only needed to see the thumbnail to decide whether they like the effect or not, instead of needing to try it out first.</p>
				<img src="img/work/igredesign/ig_galleryprototype2.png" class="img-center" style="width:100%">
				<br><br>
				<h5>ðŸ“¸ Categories</h5>
				<br>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
						<img src="img/work/igredesign/category1.png" class="img-center" style="width:100%">
						<br>
						<p>I added a new category called "For You" which contains effects that are recommended to the users based on their previously used effects and trending effects. Based on user needs of wanting to discover more effects, this category will be the default/first one that users see.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
						<img src="img/work/igredesign/category2.png" class="img-center" style="width:100%">
						<br>
						<p>In the "Saved" category, users can see the effects they've saved and easily unsave them when they want to get rid of it. Users have always struggled with navigating through saved effects. Sometimes they save an effect but realized they don't use it often and with the current user flow, it's a difficult process to remove them.</p>

				<h4>Takeaways</h4>
				<br>
				<h5>1. Keep the users informed</h5>
				<p>I've seen many cases where users stop using an app or function because they have no idea how to use it or even where to find it! Even the small things like letting the users know what they will get when they click on something. Keeping users in the loop of what's available to them can greatly enhance the user experience of an app and allow them to discover more value in it.</p>
				<br>
				<h5>2. Take into account wording problems</h5>
				<p>As a designer, it's common that we use words according to what we know about the app, but the users may not understand what the words mean. It's important to think about the target user segment, what they know and how they would think about certain wordings</p>
