				<h3>What did I do?</h3>
				<br>
				<p>During my internship, I was mainly involved in creating a website for Porsche Design and Acer's latest product, a website for MSI, one of the tech giants in Taiwan, and a mobile app for Momentum, the biggest sporting goods retailer in Taiwan.</p>
				<p>* Due to NDA, I'm unable to share the specific details of my work. But here are the highlights!</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-5">
						<h5>I conducted preliminary user research and profile analysis.</h5>
						<br>
						<p>After laying out our assumptions, I designed research questions and interviewed the users to help us validate and refine the assumptions. I was able to interview users of different demographics and I had a chance to practice asking good interview questions.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-7">
						<img src="img/work/begonia/1.png" class="img-center" style="width:100%">
					</div>
				</div>
				<br><br><br><br>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-7">
						<img src="img/work/begonia/2.png" class="img-center" style="width:100%">
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-5">
						<h5>I designed multiple wireframes and provided creative design solutions.</h5>
						<br>
						<p>I like to first draw out design ideas using pen and paper because it allows me to not focus on the visuals but the flow and function. I worked on the landing page first and had around 3-4 versions that I could discuss with other team members.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br><br><br><br>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-5">
						<h5>I participated in the end-to-end product development process and inspected for QA.</h5>
						<br>
						<p>The main project that I participated in took place during the length of my internship so I was able to follow from the beginning research phase to the final usability testing and launching phase. As a UX designer, I inspected different stages of the design closely to make sure it is up to standard.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-5">
						<h5>I worked cross-functionally with UI Designers, Product Managers, Developers, and other stakeholders.</h5>
						<br>
						<p>On top of managers, designers, and developers, I also had to work with product owners, and the client. I voiced my concerns when I had any and communicated with all stakeholders about the design and updates on the project.</p>

				<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
				<br>
				<h5>ðŸ’¬ Communication and coordination with stakeholders</h5>
				<p>When I was presenting my designs, my imagination would sometimes be different from the UI designers, like the complexity of interaction design and changes in the content layout. Or when there's a time constraint for the product that the project must be completed before the deadline. Various restrictions have highlighted how important it is to communicate and coordinate effectively between teams. I think being knowledgeable in fields like UI, PM, and development can help all members effectively communicate and find the middle ground.</p>
				<br>
				<h5>ðŸ”Ž Big discovery after using Microsoft Axure</h5>
				<br>
				<p>To be honest, when using Axure, I often thought to myself: "Axure is so ugly and hard to use, why are we using this software? Why not Figma or Sketch?" Later on, I realized that I had made a common mistake for a designer: I was paying too much attention to the visual design instead of really focusing on the user's needs.</p>
				<br>
				<h5>ðŸ‘¤ User, user, user!</h5>
				<br>
				<p>When talking about my design and thought process, I often start the sentence with "I thinkâ€¦" instead of "Usersâ€¦". I would look at things from my perspective, instead of really understanding what users need! My mentor's feedbacks for me have helped me realize that for every design, I should ask myself: 1) WHAT: What problem does this design solve? 2) WHY: Why can this design solve the problem? 3) HOW: What do users think of this design? I have come to a realization that by keep reminding myself by asking those questions really helps me produce a design that really speaks for the user.</p>
				<br>
				<h5>ðŸ’¡ Preliminary planning and research is crucial</h5>
				<br>
				<p>When I was working on my own projects, I often go straight into designing, thinking that I already knew enough about the users and wanted to finalize the design as soon as possible. After this internship, I have learned to enjoy the uncertainty and freedom that the early stages of the design process offers. Many eureka moments happened when I was bouncing ideas off of other members. Starting to design too soon will actually cause the product's purpose and positioning to lose focus, and eventually causing us to waste time when we have to go back to research and modify the product again.</p>

			<h4>Finally,</h4>
			<br>
			<p>A big thank you to everyone at Begonia Design for always patiently teaching me when I have questions, and pointing out what could be done better to help me improve. These two months had been two very happy and fulfilling months. I experienced how fulfilling it is to be able to work hard towards my passion and goals! Although there were definitely some setbacks, I hope I can become more courageous, more knowledgeable and experienced, and I'm determined to become a good designer.</p>
